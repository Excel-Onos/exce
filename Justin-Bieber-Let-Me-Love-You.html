    <p>[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]<br><br>
        I used to believe<br>
        We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)<br>
        Somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)<br>
        Sellin' a dream<br>
        Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle (Oh)<br>
        On a miracle (Oh)<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]<br><br>
        Say, go through the darkest of days<br>
        Heaven's a heartbreak away<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        Oh, it's been a hell of a ride<br>
        Driving the edge of a knife<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Justin Bieber]<br><br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no<br>
        (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2: Justin Bieber]<br><br>
        Don't fall asleep (Ooh)<br>
        At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us<br>
        Miles ahead of us<br>
        All that we need (Oh)<br>
        Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough<br>
        (Yeah) Know we're good enough<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]<br>
        Say, go through the darkest of days<br>
        Heaven's a heartbreak away<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        Oh it's been a hell of a ride<br>
        Driving the edge of a knife<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Justin Bieber]<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no<br>
        [Drop: DJ Snake]<br>
        (Oh-oh)<br>
        (Oh-oh)<br>
        (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
        <br>
        [Bridge: Justin Bieber]<br>
        Never let you go, never let you go, go<br>
        Never let you go, never let you go, go<br>
        Never let you go, woah<br>
        No, never let you go, woo<br>
        Never let you go, never let you go, go<br>
        Never let you go, never let you go, go<br>
        Oh, no, no, no, no<br>
        Never let you go, yeah, yeah<br>
        No, never let you go<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Justin Bieber]
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        Let me love you<br>
        Let me love you <br>
